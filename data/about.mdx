I'm (soon to be) a software engineer @ [IBM]() and a recent graduate of The University of Virginia, where I studied computer science and data science.
Previously, I've done software engineering at [Dell Technologies](), a [naval research base](), and IT at [Virginia Railway Express](). 

I'm super curious about low-level and highly distributed systems. I enjoy learning about computer hardware, operating systems, and cloud infrastructure.
My goal is developing tooling or infrastructure for the Linux, cloud, networking, or security spaces.

When I'm not diving into computer content, I like to stay active at the gym or tennis courts. I'm always exploring new music, and occasionally try my hand at guitar.
I try to read when I can - history, fantasy, and classics being my preference. Avid Formula 1 fan, and general car enthusiast.

My main goal for 2025 is to write more about my technical interests. Feel free to reach out for a chat about anything, I'm always looking to learn more from passionate engineers ðŸ˜Š
