I'm (soon to be) a software engineer @ [IBM]() and a recent graduate of The University of Virginia, where I studied computer science and data science.
Previously, I've done software engineering at [Dell Technologies](), a [naval research base](), and IT at [Virginia Railway Express](). 

I'm super curious about all things low-level, whether it's new processor optimizations, development in the Linux kernel, or a new systems programming language.
Particularly, I'm fascinated by the world of operating systems, regarding security and scaling for distributed systems. 

My goal is to work on projects involved or adjacent to cloud infrastructure, Linux tooling, or OS development.
I'm still exploring my niche interests, but any opportunity to build on these sorts of things fascinates me.

When I'm not diving into computer content, I like to stay active at the gym or tennis courts. I also love movies, reading, and listening to new music - I always appreciate recommendations. 
Obsessed with Formula 1, and motorsports generally.
