Hi, I'm Riley. I'm currently studying computer science and data science at the University of Virginia. Previously, I've done software 
engineering Dell Technologies, the U.S. Navy, and information technology at Virginia Railway Express.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about networks and cloud infrastructure, but I love anything systems programming - be it security, hardware, 
embedded. I've been a teaching assistant for Computer Systems I and II at UVA since Spring '24.

Long term, I want to help build more efficient and fault tolerant solutions for distributed, embedded, and operating systems. 
The numerous angles of attack for optimizing systems at scale is fascinating, and I love to explore and better understand them. 
I'm also a big fan of open-source development and Linux tooling.

Beyond tech, I like playing guitar, creative writing, and learning about finance, history, and philosophy. I try to spend time away
from the computer outside, where I often find myself playing tennis, mountain biking, and hiking.
